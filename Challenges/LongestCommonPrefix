# Problem statement:

# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

# Solution:

# Input Example:

#     Example 1:
#     Let the set of strings to be {"flower", "fly", "flow"}
#     The longest common prefix is "fl"

#     Example 2:
#     Let the set of strings to be {"dog", "donkey", "door", "cat"}
#     The longest common prefix is "", i.e., empty string. 
#     Since there is no common prefix at all.
