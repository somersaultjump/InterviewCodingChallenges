# Problem statement:

# Given a binary string find the number of substring that can formed such that every substring starts with '1' and ends with '1'.

# Example:

#     Input string:
#     100110100

#     Output:
#     6

#     Explanation:
#     Substrings those start with '1' and end with '1'.
#     1001
#     10011
#     1001101
#     11
#     1101
#     101
#     N.B: Don't think that substrings are:
#     1001
#     11
#     101 
#     These only
